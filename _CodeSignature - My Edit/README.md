I edited "CodeResources" file for an issue with uYouPlus reinstallation. <b> [Issue Link](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/issues/360#issuecomment-1214204795)</b><br>
In this "CodeResources" file I remove all "MessagesExtension.appex" code from this file.<br>
File location: Payload\YouTube.app\_CodeSignature\CodeResources
<br><b>Issue solved for me.</b>
